# Marketing
## What Marketing is
-	Persuading customers to buy something
-	Identify what products or services would be profitable to sell to customers
	-	Often done via market research
-	The government is one of the biggest spenders in the UK on marketing
	-	Not to persuade customers to buy a product or service, but rather to inform UK citizens about something
-	Inform customers about what the product or service is and does
-	All 3 sectors of the economy use marketing
## Target marketing
-	Businesses need a good understanding of their target market for several reasons
	-	Advertising only to people who are more likely to buy the product or service, so they spend less on advertising
	-	Know where customers are geographically, so they can position their products or services in more convenient locations
-	A market or marketplace: where buyers and sellers can come together to buy or sell goods or services
-	Market Segmentation
	-	Splitting customers into categories to group buyers together who have similar characteristics or buying patterns
	-	Businesses often sell their product or service to only one or two segment of the market
	-	Can be segmented by age, gender, hobbies, interests, location, education level, socio-economic groups, religion or race, income groups, lifestyle, etc
	-	Market Segmentation makes it easier to target customers as groups
-	Market Research
	-	Many methods can be done to collect data for market research
		-	Making surveys or questionnaires, or looking at surveys found by others
			-	Can contain data that is both quantitative and qualitative
			-	Postal surveys can be sent out in the post, online surveys can be sent out via the internet

			-	Rolling it out to a larger area after test marketing goes well
	-	Used to gain a deeper understanding into their target market
	-	Field Research (Primary market research)
		-	Gives data that is more closely tailored to the business than Desk Research
		-	Getting new information first-hand

		-	<Question client:visible q={`"Describe methods of field research which could be used by an organisation." (4 marks)`}>
				Surveys or questionnaires, sets of questions used for market research, can be conducted by mail or online, and are a cost effective method of research to carry out, though they can result in unclear answers due to participants often being unable to ask for clarification on questions. (1)
				
				Personal interviews or focus groups, where information can be obtained from face-to-face interactions, can allow participants to feel more comfortable giving answers, but a good interviewer can cost a lot to hire and must be paid in order to collect responses.

				Focus groups - Gathering a group of people together to discuss a product or service (1)
				
				Online surveys - Sending out sets of questions online to gather both qualitative and quantitative information (1)
				
				Telephone surveys - Surveys done via telephone, a professional interviewer must be paid to ask questions, which could be expensive  (1)
				
				Personal interviews - Discussions with a person to ask questions or experiences with a product. An interviewer must be paid to ask questions, which may be expensive (1)

	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Describe the use of market research." (3 marks)`}>
			Market research is used by organisations to find out more about several properties of the market, such as what kind of people purchase the product or service and how much they would pay for it.

			Market research helps businesses better target the segment that is most likely to spend money on the business (1), gives an indication of what prices to set (1), and shows needs and wants of customers.

			This helps increase their sales for when the business launches the product or service, which increases their profits. It also helps the business react easier to changes in the market (1).

			Businesses that use market research often have lower levels of risk when entering a new market, and market research allows them to make better decisions about launches of products or services.

				Packaging may possibly be the only way to display the brand of the product, and a strong or well-known brand can increase sales of the product or service. (1)

				Packaging can also help to protect the product during transportation, and less damage to a product will result in the customer being more satisfied with it. (1)

				Packaging can be used to help pick the target markets that the organisation wants to buy the product, such as adding cartoon characters to make the product appeal more to children. (1)

				Good packaging can be expensive or difficult to manufacture or design, (1)
