# Social Behaviour
## Non-verbal communication
-	Non-verbal communication is communication without using spoken or written language
## Conformity
-	The Asch paradigm - Where the behaviours and actions of one person is influenced by the rest of the group
	-	It even happens if the group is comprised of strangers to the participant
-	The Elevator Experiment
	-	People often slowly turn to face the back of the elevator, only to conform with the rest of the group
		-	They may think that the rest of the group knew something that they didn't about the elevator
		-	They might not want to be the sole person who is acting differently to the rest of the group, possibly for fear of being left out
	-	If there are several people in an elevator facing the wrong direction, will another person walk in and conform to face the wrong direction?
-	The waiting room experiment
	-	If there are several people sitting in a waiting room that all stand up when a tone sounds, will another person walk in and conform?
	-	They stand up when the stone sounds, for no reason other than just because everyone else was doing it
	-	Even after everyone has left the waiting room, the person still stands up when the tone sounds
-	Trends can often push you to follow them
-	Conformity is usually unspoken, changing how we act to match what we observe others doing
-	Social influence is when our feelings, behaviours, and thoughts are influenced by other people
-	Types of Conformity
	-	Compliance
		-	Changing your actions, but still disagreeing internally, keeping the same internal beliefs
		-	eg. Listening to the same music as your friends while with them, but not in private
		-	Conforming publicly, no change in private views; only complying with social norms
		-	The weakest form of conformity, has the least effect on an individual
		-	Usually done to avoid punisment, gain rewards, or avoid being thought of badly
		-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain how compliance differs from internalisation." (4 marks)`}>
				Compliance is when someone's outside actions change, but their internal beliefs stay the same. They conform in public, but not privately. (1)

				Internalisation is when someone's outside actions change, and their internal beliefs change as well. They conform both in public and in private. (1)

				The differences are that in compliance, change in actions is temporary (1), whereas in internalisation, change in actions is permanent. (1)
				In compliance, your internal beliefs do not change (1), but in internalisation, your internal beliefs do change. (1)
			</Question>
	-	Identification
		-	Changing your actions and even your private beliefs, but changing to a different belief and behaviour after leaving a group
		-	eg. Supporting and believing in your school's sports team, but after moving schools, changing to support and believe in that school's sports team
		-	Conforming publicly and privately, but not permanently; identifying with a group
		-	Stronger than compliance, but weaker than internalisation
	-	Internalisation
		-	Changing your internal beliefs and core values as well as your outside actions permanently, not changing back
		-	eg. Your friends introduce you to a new activity you like, and you still do that activity even if you no longer see those friends
		-	Permanently confirming publicly and privately; internalising your new beliefs
		-	The strongest form of conformity
		-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain Aleksandra’s behaviour using the concept of internalisation." (4 marks) (see note)`}>
				"Aleksandra’s parents go hunting and used to take her with them. Her friends are
				against this, and now Aleksandra is, too."

				Internalisation is when beliefs are changed both publicly and privately after conforming to others.
				Aleksandra has conformed to their friends, and now holds the same beliefs on hunting as them.
			</Question>
-	It is done by someone to fit into a group due to social influences
-	Asch Conformity Experiments (1951)
	-	Seven of the eight were confederates (paid actors) that gave the wrong answers on 12 questions
		-	On the other 6 questions, the actors gave correct answers to gain the trust of the participants
	-	Aimed to find out if a participant would conform to others giving wrong answers to an obvious question
	-	25% of particpants did not conform at all, 75% conformed on at least one question, and 5% conformed on every question
	-	<ins>Weaknesses</ins>
		-	The participants in the experiment were not very culturally diverse,  all male, and of similar socio-economic status
			-	This makes the results difficult to generalise to a larger population
		-	Peer pressure could be considered harmful and unethical
		-	The study relied on the good acting of the confederates
			-	If their acting was not believed by the participant, the participant could have figured out that the experiment was a psychological study
			-	Some confederates may have been better at acting than others
		-	The advertisement, using volunteer sampling, may have attracted only a specific type of person
		-	Low ecological validity: as a lab experiment, it did not reflect on conformity in day-to-day life
			-	Comparing two lines several times is not something many people have to do every day, low mundane realism
		-	<Question client:visible q={`"Identify 2 weaknesses of Asch's study." (2 marks)`}>
				Participants were all white, american men, meaning the results couldn't be easily generalised to a wider population. (1)

				The study also relied heavily on the ability of the confederates to act well, and bad acting could mean that the participant finds out that the experiment is a psychological study. (1)

				The experiment had low ecological validity and low mundane realism, due to being conducted in a lab, the study was unable to reflect upon conformity in the real world. (1)
			</Question>
	-	Participants matched one line to 3 possible lines, asked each particpant to say which lines matched
	-	36.8% of questions were answered incorrectly
	-	The real participant was seated in chair 7, meaning the participant got exposed to more viewpoints, making them more likely to conform
	-	<ins>Strengths</ins> 
		-	The study was the first of its kind
			-	In previous conformity experiments, the participants usually didn't know the answers to the questions, whereas in Asch's study, the answers were obvious
		-	The study was cheap to carry out, and easy to replicate it
		-	Acted as a basis for future research
		-	The study was able to demonstrate both types of social influences as main reasons for conforming
			-	Normative Social Influence, where participants did not want to embarrass themselves by giving a different answer to the rest of the group, leading to compliance
			-	Informative Social Influence, where participants thought that their answer must have been wrong and the group’s answer was correct, leading to internalisation
-	Types of Social Influences
	-	Normative social influence
		-	eg. Someone liking the same things as their friends, in order to fit in and so others don't see them as different
		-	Pressure to conform comes from other people in the group
			-	Often results in compliance rather than identification or internalisation
		-	Caused by our desire to be liked and accepted by others
	-	Informational social influence
		-	When someone is unsure about a correct answer, behaviour, or opinion, so they adopt that of others they believe to be correct
		-	Jenness (1932) study
			-	Estimating how many beans were in a jar
			-	After being told others' guesses, almost all participants changed their guess to be closer to the average
			-	Participants may have conformed because they thought others' guesses might be more accurate
		-	Caused by our desire to be right
		-	eg. Someone following strangers on the street in a foreign place, because they believe the strangers might know something that they don't
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Bobby conforms because of the influence of his friends. Name and describe two types of social influence that Bobby may experience." (6 marks)`}>
			Normative social influence is when someone conforms to a group in order to be liked or accepted by that group (1). This usually causes compliance, where only actions are changed, not internal beliefs. (1)

			This may have affected Bobby and made them want to conform to the group if they wanted to fit in to the group so they accept them or like them more, or for fear of being rejected from the group if they did not conform (1). The group influences Bobby's actions, but not internal thoughts. (1)

			Informative social influence is when someone conforms to a group because they see the group as trustworthy, or think the group knows something that they don't. It could also be when someone doesn't know what an accepted behaviour or opinion is, so they use that of the group (1). It is caused by a desire to be right. (1)

			This may have affected Bobby and made them conform to the group because they thought the group knew more about something than they did. (1)
		</Question>
-	Individual factors that affect conformity
	-	Gender
		-	In the Mori & Arai study, women conformed at rates of 29%, similar to those of participants in the Asch study, whereas men in the same study did not conform at all
			-	It has been suggested that this may be because women often take a communal role and promote harmony in groups
				-	In contrast, men were traditionally brought up to maintain their independence instead
			-	The Mori & Arai study showed that women tended to conform more than men
	-	Personality and Self-esteem
		-	People with low self-esteem normally conform more, as they don't want to stand out as much
			-	Might not accept themselves due to low self-worth, so conform because they  want others to accept them or have a fear of rejection
		-	Those with higher self-esteem usually conform less
			-	Often are confident in themselves, and feel less negative pressure when they stand out
	-	Age
		-	Teens are usually more likely to conform than young children or older adults
			-	Teens can be highly susceptible to social influence, as relationships begin to become more important from ages 12 to 18
				-	Teens are also more likely to take bigger risks while in large groups
			-	Adults are often set up in life as an individual and are more secure with who they are, and young children are often not affected by others' thoughts of them
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain why Adam conforms using your knowledge of individual and cultural factors." (6 marks) (see note)`}>
			"Adam has just started a new job. Adam is at a work meeting with a group of 4 of his colleagues from his department. All 4 of the colleagues mention that they send paper notes to reception with messages instead of emails. Adam believes this is time consuming and usually emails, however he conforms and sends paper notes moving forward."

			Adam might have low self-esteem or self-worth, so may have a fear of being rejected by his colleagues or be less confident in his answer, (1) and therefore uses paper notes instead of emails because he wants to be accepted by his colleagues. (1)
			
			Since Adam is male, he is less likely to conform to others yet still conformed in this scenario. It has been suggested that this is because many women used to promote harmony and take a communal role in groups, whereas men did not. If Adam was female, they would have a higher chance of conforming to the group (1). The 2010 Mori & Arai study showed that men have a lower chance of conforming to a group than women.
			
			Adam's age also has an effect on his conformity,

			Adam might also live in an area with a collectivist culture, which would increase his chances of conforming (1). Collectivist cultures tend to put more emphasis on groups and fitting in, which tends to promote conformity and following the majority. (1)
			
			If Adam was from an individualistic culture, then he would be less likely to conform (1). This is because individualistic cultures are more focused on making decisions for yourself. (1)
		</Question>
-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain factors that affect conformity in relation to the case." (4 marks) (see note)`}>
		"Lucy & her brother Tom have started at a new school. They both used to be big football fans, however everyone at their new school supports basketball. Lucy conforms and pretends to like basketball too, but Tom does not."

		Since Lucy is a woman, this increases their chances of conformity as women have traditionally been brought up to promote harmony in groups and take communal roles (1). If Lucy was male, this may decrease their chances of conforming, as men have been traditionally brought up to 
		
		Lucy may have low self-esteem, which will increase their chances of conforming as they may not have as much confidence in their decisions and may not want to stand out as much. (1)
		
		If Lucy is from a collectivist culture, this could make them more likely to conform, as collectivist cultures normally value group achievements over individual successes and value following a group over making decisions individually. (1)

		Since Tom is a man, this decreases their chances of conformity, as men have traditionally been brought up to maintain their independence. (1)
		
		Tom may have high self-esteem, which will decrease their chance of conformity as they will be more confident in their decisions and could be more confident in standing out from others. (1)
		
		Tom also may be from an individualistic culture, decreasing their chances to conform. This is because individualistic cultures usually value individual achievements over group successes, and value independence over being in a group. (1)
	</Question>
-	Situational factors that affect conformity
	-	Group Size
		-	Another variation on the Asch experiment changed the number of confederates, ranging from 1 to 15
			-	Conformity was at its lowest with only 1 confederate, rates of only 3%
				-	With 2 confederates, conformity rates jumped up to 12.8%
			-	With 3 confederates, conformity rates almost tripled to 33.3%, almost to the value of the original study with 7 confederates
				-	Having more than 3 confederates did not make as significant a difference to conformity rates
				-	Asch believed that a group of 3 people is the key number of people to form a "group", and this makes it harder to reject their opinions
	-	Task Difficulty
		-	Asch changed the question cards, so that the 3 comparison lines were much closer in length, increasing the task's difficulty and making answers less obvious
			-	This was found to greatly increase the rate of conformity
			-	This may have made it easier for participants to feel as if they had chosen the incorrect answer, leading to more informational social influence
				-	The less sure we are about our answer, the more likely we are to get guidance from others in the group and accept their answer.
	-	Group unanimity / Social support
		-	A variation on the Asch conformity experiment had the 4th confederate, an "ally", give the true answer to reduce the unanimity of the group
			-	This greatly reduced the chances of the participant conforming to the majority answers of the group, from 36.8% to only 5%
			-	Participants felt much more comfortable with giving the correct answer, as they weren't the odd one out
			-	Even when the ally gave a different but still incorrect answer to the rest of the group, the conformity rates still dropped significantly, to 9%
				-	Participants knew that even if their answer was incorrect, they still wouldn't be the odd one out
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain why Adam conforms using your knowledge of situational factors." (6 marks) (see note)`}>
			"Adam has just started a new job. Adam is at a work meeting with a group of 4 of his colleagues from his department. All 4 of the colleagues mention that they send paper notes to reception with messages instead of emails. Adam believes this is time consuming and usually emails, however he conforms and sends paper notes moving forward."

			Adam's colleagues are a group of 4 people, so Adam has a higher chance of conforming than if he had less than 3 colleagues with a different opinion (1). The Asch conformity experiments showed that 3 people is the critical number of people to form a "group", where conformity rates increased drastically (1). It's also harder to dissent from a group, as the person might feel they will be judged more than a smaller group. (1) 

			Since Adam is in his new job, he may be more likely to conform due to Informational Social Influence, as he may not know exactly what to do. (1)

			The fact that all of his colleagues decided to use paper notes rather than emails meant that Adam was more likely to conform due to the unanimity of the group (1). He may have thought that his decision to write emails instead of paper notes was incorrect, so looked to the group for guidance on the correct answer. (1)
		</Question>
-	Cultural factors that affect conformity
	-	Collectivist cultures
		-	Cultures where group achivements and following the majority are thought of as better than individual decisions
		-	Causes members to conform more than those in individualistic cultures
	-	Individualistic cultures
		-	Cultures where individual decisions and beliefs are more accepted than those of a group
		-	Causes members to conform less than those in collectivist cultures
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain cultural factors that may influence conformity." (4 marks)`}>
			People from individualistic cultures are brought up to be individuals and maintain independence (1). Individual achievements are valued over group successes, and conformity rates in individualistic cultures are lower. (1)

			People from collectivist cultures are brought up to work in groups and follow the crowd (1). Group achievements are valued more than individual successes, and conformity rates in collectivist cultures are higher. (1)
		</Question>
-	Minority & Majority influence
	-	An out-group is a social group with which an individual does not identify
	-	It is human nature to want to be part of a group most of the time
		-	This may have helped people survive by sharing food, skills, and helping each other
	-	"Us vs Them" approach
	-	Majority influence is when an individual or small group is influenced by a large, majority group
		-	Most conformity studies concentrate on majority influence
		-	eg. Asch Conformity Experiments, Mori & Arai study, Jenness study
	-	An in-group is a social group to which a person psychologically identifies as being a member
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain Majority and Minority influence."`}>
			Majority influence is when an individual or small group is influenced by the larger, majority group to conform to them.
			Minority influence is when many people from a majority group is influenced by a smaller, minority group to join them.
		</Question>
	-	"Why might pressure from a minority have a greater long-term effect on behaviour and opinions compared to the majority?"
	-	Minority influence is when a single individual or minority changes the views or behaviour of a majority group
		-	First follower
			-	Publicly shows the others how to follow
			-	Turns a lone individual into a leader
			-	Takes confidence to be a first follower in case of being ridiculed
		-	A leader needs to stand alone and be confident, make sure the followers get noticed so more join
		-	Second follower
			-	Shows that the first follower was doing well
			-	Follows the first one, not the leader
			-	Having 3 people now means it is a group, allowing for more power
		-	The tipping point
			-	When the number of people joined increases rapidly, now becomes the majority group
		-	Minority influence requires the following:
			-	Consistency, making sure that your goals don't change, holding the same position
				-	The Foot in the Door effect means that it's more likely that something will be granted if demands increase slowly
			-	Staying confident and passionate
				-	People must be sure of their purpose, future success, and have confidence in succeeding
			-	Stay flexible and unbiassed
				-	Must seem cooperative and reasonable, not uncompromising
			-	Keep fighting for the cause to be able to make change
				-	Must believe in the importance, willing to suffer to achieve the goal
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain the differences between minority and majority social influence in relation to conformity." (4 marks)`}>
			Majority influence is more likely to result in internalisation, whereas minority influence is more likely to result in compliance. This is because most people who are influenced by a minority do so at their own accord, instead of being pressured to comply.
		</Question>
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain how knowledge of minority influence could help the government to decrease the number of people working at home." (4 marks)`}>
			"The Government want to improve the nation's work/home balance by encouraging people to get back to the office after working from home for 2 Covid affected years. They want people to give up working at home and instead work in their office/building, etc."

			Passion & Confidence: Give reasons to why an office is a better place to work than at home, and being confident about how this will improve 

			Consistency: Making sure that they are keeping the same message, not compromising and remaining constant with their views. (1)

			Fight for the cause: Be able to prove that they are confident in their beliefs by providing compensation to those willing to go into the office, or campaigning by using posters to influence people. (!)

			Flexible & Unbiased: Can be flexible by requesting that people spend at least some of their time in an office
		</Question>
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Describe what is meant by minority influence." (2 marks)`}>
			A small number of people in a group being able to convince the majority of the group (1) to change their behaviour (1).

	-	Moscovici et al (1969)
		-	A group of 6 people were asked to state the colour of a blue square placed in front of them
			-	The group contained 4 participants and 2 confederates
		-	The confederates in the group were told to 
-	Mori & Arai (2010) study
	-	Participants were put in groups of 4, were given glasses and said they were to protect their eyes
		-	Just like in the Asch study, the participant with the altered glasses was asked to answer second-last out of the group
		-	The glasses given to the 3rd person were different, and made them see different lines to everyone else for 12 out of 18 questions
	-	<ins>Strengths</ins> 
		-	The study used male and female participants, this was able to produce more easily generalised results
		-	Each participant in a group knew the others, meaning the minority participant was more likely to conform to the others
			-	There was more perceived risk to not conforming, as the person was likely to come back into contact with the others again
			-	People conforming to their friends is more common than conforming to strangers
		-	The study did not use confederates, so the actions of the majority participants would be real and less likely to be viewed as fake
	-	Designed to replicate and improve the Asch study, but without the influence of confederates
	-	Big differences were found between the Japanese men and women conforming
		-	This is thought to be due to cultural expectations in Japan
			-	If men were brought up  to value independence  more, they would conform far less as a result
		-	Men conformed very little if at all
		-	Women conformed at approximately the same rate as men in the Asch study
	-	<ins>Weaknesses</ins> 
		-	Their technique could be considered unethical, as they deceived the participants by telling them the glasses were used to prevent glare
			-	Although deception was considered necessary, and it used less deception than the original Asch experiment
		-	The study still had low ecological validity, as the scenario was not very true to day-to-day life and was conducted in a lab
		-	It also still had low mundane realism, as the task was not something that is usually done day-to-day
		-	The study only used Japanese participants, unable to generalise results to other countries
-	<Question client:visible q={`"How might individual and cultural factors affect conformity?" (5 marks)`}>
		Self-esteem: People with lower self-esteem may be more likely to conform (1), as they are more self-conscious of how they appear to others, and have a greater desire to be liked by others (1) and may not want to stand out from others. (1)

		Gender: Women may be more likely to conform than men, as traditionally they have been brought up to promote harmony in groups and take communal roles, whereas men have traditionally been brought up to be independent, so are less likely to conform to a group (1)

		Age: People between the ages of 11 and 18 are most likely to conform (1), as this is when people care most about their appearance to others and value peer relationships most and feel peer pressure more (1). Adults are less likely to conform. (1)

		Collectivist cultures: Cultures where groups are thought of to be better than individuals, and group achievements are valued over individual successes, people from these cultures are more likely to conform to groups. (1)

		Individualistic cultures: Cultures where individuals are thought of to be better than groups, and individual achievements are valued over group successes, people from these cultures are less likely to conform to groups. (1)
	</Question>
-	In a nutshell:
	-	Social influence: Normative (want to be liked), Informative (want to be right)
		-	Normative usually happens with a group and trying to be liked by them, usually by compliance
			-	eg. giving the same answer as the group due to not wanting to dissent against them
		-	Informative usually happens in a new situation and trying to find out what is correct, usually by internalisation
			-	eg. new setting, where a task is difficult or are unsure about the answer
	-	Types of conformity: Compliance, Internalisation
		-	Internalisation: Permanent public and private change
			-	Usually Informative social influence, eg. learning something with someone else and liking it
		-	Compliance: Temporary public only change, disagree privately
			-	Usually Normative social influence, eg. conforming to a friend group to be liked by them
	-	Situational factors: Task difficulty, Group size, Group unanimity
		-	Task difficulty: A more difficult task increases conformity levels
			-	With a more difficult task, people are more likely to be unsure about the answer
				-	This results in informative social influence
		-	Group size: Larger groups (3+) increase conformity levels
			-	More than 2 people is considered a group, and is harder to dissent against
		-	Group unanimity: A group with everyone acting the same increases conformity levels
			-	If someone in the group gives a different answer, this will decrease conformity levels
		-	Variations on the Asch experiments have studied these factors
	-	Cultural factors: Collectivist and Individualistic cultures
		-	Collectivist: Cultures where individuals are thought of as better than groups
			-	Group achievements are valued more than individual achievements
			-	Conformity rates are higher in collectivist cultures than individualistic cultures
				-	Due to being rewarded for and brought up with working as a team and contributing to group goals
		-	Asch vs Mori & Arai cannot be used as evidence, as this comparison includes generational factors
		-	Individualistic: Cultures where groups are thought of as better than individuals
			-	Individual successes are valued over group achievements
			-	Conformity rates are lower in individualistic cultures than collectivist cultures
				-	Due to being brought up with and rewarded for being independent and working as an individual
	-	Individual factors: Gender, Age, Self esteem
		-	Gender: Women are more likely to conform than men
			-	Because women have in the past been brought up to promote group harmony
				-	Men have traditionally been brought up to be individuals and maintain independence
			-	The Mori & Arai study found that women conformed, whereas men showed no conformity
		-	Age: Younger people between the ages of 11-18 are more likely to conform
			-	This is because people care a lot about their appearance and being liked by others at this age
				-	Valuing peer relationships more at this stage in life
		-	Self-esteem: People with lower self-esteem have higher conformity rates
			-	People with lower self esteem value being liked by others more
				-	Increases likelihood to conform due to Normative social influence
# Individual Behaviour
## Sleep and Dreams
-	There is no particular amount of sleep that is ideal
	-	The average adult sleeps 7 - 8 hours nightly
		-	10% of the population need up to 10 hours
		-	5% of the population only need as low as 5 hours
	-	The main criteria for getting enough sleep is whether you feel in good shape afterwards
-	<Question client:visible q={`"Describe what is meant by sleep." (2 marks)`}>
		Sleep is a state of reduced consciousness, where the body is less responsive to stimulation. (1)

		Sleep is commonly split up into 4 or 5 different stages. Cycles of these stages repeat every 1.5 to 2 hours. Sleep used to produce growth hormones and repair the body and brain (1). It is also when dreams occur.
	</Question>
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Describe what is meant by dreams." (2 marks)`}>
			Dreams occur largely during REM sleep, when brain activity is similar to that of being awake (1). They are characterised by a series of visualisations, images, or sensations that can occur during sleep.
		</Question>
-	REM & Non-REM sleep
	-	REM sleep is a fairly light stage of sleep, and is when 90% of dreams occur
		-	REM sleep is the time when the brain restores itself
		-	Body temperature and heart rate can sometimes rise during REM periods
		-	Muscle tensing and eye twitching can sometimes happen during REM sleep
			-	This is caused by brain activity being similar to being awake
		-	Waking up during REM sleep makes it far more likely to remember dreams
	-	Non-REM or NREM sleep consists of 4 stages, and is when only 10% of dreams happen
		-	NREM sleep is the time when the body repairs itself
		-	In these stages, body temperature drops and heart rate slows
		-	The long, slow, and deep brain waves that occur during NREM sleep are called Delta waves
	-	Sleep is not one state, it goes through 5 main stages which repeat many times per night
		-	Stages 1 to 4 are all NREM sleep
			-	Stage 1 is the lightest type of NREM sleep, and is easy to wake up from
				-	Stage 1 sleep occurs only at the beginning and end of the night
				-	Stage 2 sleep occurs more and more frequently in later sleep cycles
			-	Stage 4 is the deepest type of sleep, and is the most difficult to wake up from
				-	Stages 3 and 4 (deep sleep) decrease in frequency and length towards the end of the night.
		-	Sections of REM sleep increase in length of time until the person wakes up
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain what is meant by REM & NREM sleep." (6 marks)`}>
			REM sleep is a light stage of sleep, and is where most dreams occur (1). Few dreams occur during NREM sleep. NREM sleep consists of 4 stages, where 1 is the lightest and easiest to wake up from, and 4 is the deepest and most difficult to wake up from.
			
			REM sleep is the stage where the brain repairs itself, whereas NREM sleep is the stages where the body repairs itself.
			
			During REM sleep, body temperature and heart rate can rise, as brain activity is similar to being awake. During NREM sleep, body temperature and heart rate can drop, and brain waves are longer, slower, and deeper. These types of waves are called delta waves.

-	In the Randy Gardner experiment, Gardner stayed awake for 11 days straight
	-	They then slept for 14 hours and felt well-rested afterwards
-	There are (4 or) 5 stages of sleep
	-	These stages happen in cycles that last 90 minutes to 2 hours each
		-	Waking up at the end of a cycle is ideal, as this helps you feel more alert after waking
		-	Children, Adults, and Elderly people all show different patterns of sleep
			-	Women tend to have shorter cycles of sleep
-	The Biological approach to Sleep and Dreams
	-	The belief that behaviours are due to our DNA and genetics
		-	These behaviors are fixed, and many cannot be changed
	-	The biological appreach focuses on the body, especially the nervous system and brain
		-	It uses these factors to predict and analyse behaviour
		-	Imbalances in the brain affect our behaviour, and this must be corrected to fix it
	-	Being a "morning person" or "evening person" is a biological phenomenon

		-	<ins>Strengths</ins>
			-	Is based in science, is supported by clinical research
				-	This allows other researchers to replicate the results in different studies
			-	The use of the EEG as part of sleep studies has provided lots of evidence for different sleep stages
		-	<ins>Weaknesses</ins>
			-	Reductionism means that it oversimplifies the complexity of human emotion and behaviour
				-	This is becaues we cannot understand sleep and dreams completely if only biological factors are focussed on
				-	Psychological, cultural, and social factors also contribute to quantity and quality of sleep and dreams
-	Sleep can be defined as a state of reduced conscious awarness
	-	During sleep, the body is less active and less responsive
-	Scientists found that sleep depriving rats for 17 days caused them to die
-	Dement & Kleitman (1957) Study
	-	The study aimed to find the link between dreams and sleep stages
		-	Aimed to uncover the reasons for Rapid Eye Movement during sleep
		-	Aimed to find if there was a relationship between length of REM sleep and length of dreams
	-	Observed 9 adults (7 men, 2 women)
		-	Asked to avoid all stimulants including caffeine and alcohol, and their brain activity was monitored with EOG machines
	-	<ins>Strengths</ins>
		-	The lab setting helped to control external variables in order to improve reliability of the results
			-	Participants were asked not to use alcohol or caffeine, which further increased reliability
		-	The difference in participants being able to remember their dreams in REM vs NREM sleep was very large, 80% to only 9%
		-	The study was the first of its kind, and influenced other research with its strong evidence and conclusions
			-	It was the first to prove that REM sleep is connected to dreaming, before that it was only thought to have a different function
		-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain one strength of the Dement and Kleitman study." (2 marks)`}>
				The study used a lab setting, so external variables could be easily controlled (1). This made the experiment easier to replicate. (1)

				The study was the first of its kind, provided valuable information about what REM & NREM sleep was used for, and had great influence on future studies. (2)
			</Question>
	-	Participants that were woken up later (15 mins after REM started) reported that their dreams were longer than those who were woken up earlier (5 mins after REM started) 
	-	<ins>Weaknesses</ins> 
		-	Small sample size and gender bias made the results difficult to generalise to a wider population
		-	The study had low ecological validity, the participants were in a lab setting and awoken several times per night
			-	To control extraneous variables with a lab setting requires sacrificing ecological validity
		-	Participants had to report on the content of their dreams themselves, which may have caused unreliable data
		-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain one weakness of the Dement and Kleitman study." (2 marks)`}>
				The experiment had low ecological validity, as it was set in a lab setting where participants were woken up often, which isn't representative of natural sleep (1). This may have caused unreliable results, and made them more difficult to generalise to a larger population. (1)

				The study only used a small sample size of 7 men and 2 women (1),  so the results may not be as reliable as a larger study, and would be more difficult to generalise to a larger population. (1)

	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Describe the aims of the Dement & Kleitman study." (3 marks)`}>
			The study aimed to find the link between stages of sleep and dreams (1). It also aimed to find out the reasons for Rapid Eye Movement occurring during sleep, (1) and to find whether length of REM sleep and length of dreams were related. (1)
		</Question>
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain the method and procedure of the Dement & Kleitman study." (4 marks)`}>
			All participants were asked to not use alcohol or caffeine before entering a sleep lab for the study. Participants included 7 men and 2 women (1).

			While sleeping, the participants were monitored using EOG machines to track when they entered REM sleep (1). Participants were woken up during their sleep, and were asked if they could recall any dreams they had, and those who were woken up later (15 mins after REM began) recalled that their dreams lasted longer than those who were woken up earlier (5 mins after REM began). (1)
		</Question>
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Describe one conclusion of the Dement and Kleitman study." (1 mark)`}>
			The study showed that REM sleep plays an important role in dreaming, as it is where most dreams occur. (1)

	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Evaluate the Dement & Kleitman study into  sleep." (6 marks)`}>
			Strengths:

			-	It was the first study of its kind, and provided valuable insight into what the different stages of sleep were for. (1)

			Weaknesses:

			-	The study had low mundane realism, as it was conducted in a sleep lab which may have affected the participants' sleep, as it was not a familiar environment for them. (1)
			-	The study had low ecological validity, as the participants were woken up several times during the night, which could affect their sleep quality. (1)
			-	The study used a small sample size of 7 men and 2 women, so it could have caused biassed results. (1)
		</Question>
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"What do the results of the Dement and Kleitman study tell us about REM sleep?" (4 marks)`}>
			The study found that REM sleep was important for dreaming, as it is when most dreams occur. It was the first study to find out that REM sleep was connected to dreaming. (1)
			
			It also found that the activity of the eyes during dreaming was related to the content of the dream. (1)
			
			It discovered that if a person was awoken a short time (5 minutes) after REM sleep began, dreams were reported to be shorter than those from people who were woken up a longer time (15 minutes) after REM sleep began. (1)
			
			NREM sleep was discovered to be mostly separate from dreaming, as it was found that 80% of dreams occurred during REM sleep, while only 9% occurred during NREM sleep. (1)

-	Oswald's (1966) Restoration Theory 
	-	What happens in REM
		-	Without sleep, negative moods could be more common
			-	Concentration would be more difficult during the day, and learning may be more difficult
		-	Babies have lots more REM sleep time than adults, about 9 hours a day, as the brain is developing extremely fast
		-	Sleep is an important way of replenishing neurotransmitters
			-	Sleep is important for organising and storing memories: they are converted from short-term to long-term, and unimportant memories are removed
	-	Proposed that the function of sleep is to replenish the body and brain after a day
	-	Oswald believed that REM sleep restored the brain, and NREM sleep restored the body
	-	What happens in NREM
		-	Sleep is used by the body to remove waste products
		-	Sleep can be used for muscle repair
			-	Tissue repair and growth also occurs during sleep
		-	Sleep is important for protein synthesis, creating protein molecules for the body
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain the restoration theory of sleep (Oswald, 1966)" (6 marks)`}>
			The theory suggested that sleep is used to replenish the body and brain after a day. Oswald believed that NREM sleep was used for restoring the body, and REM sleep was used for restoring the brain.

		-	Relied heavily upon observations and case studies of patients
			-	Believed that dreams are coded or disguised versions of deepest desires, memories, and fears
	-	Believes that the brain and the mind are separate, that we also have a soul
	-	The psychoanalytic (Freudian) theory of dreams/The Wish fulfillment theory of dreams
		-	Freud wrote up some dream dictionaries, showing what imagery in dreams meant
			-	Showing what innocent symbols were covering up something more sinister
				-	A school: Scared of being judged
				-	A storm: Emotional turmoil
				-	Teeth falling out: Worries or lack of control, connections with money
				-	Pregnancy: A new aspect of self is happening
				-	Exams or tests: Signify self-evaluation
				-	Nudity: Symbolises revealing true self to others
				-	Being physically trapped: Real life inability to escape or make the correct choice
				-	Vehicles: Show how much control you have over your life
				-	Teachers: Can show authority figures that can enlighten you
				-	Food: Abundance, life, prosperity
		-	Freud believed dreams have two purposes: wish fulfillment, and a disguise using symbols to protect the sleeper
		-	Freud believed that dreams involve wish fulfilment
			-	Freud was one of the first to propose the idea that dreams meant something
			-	The unconscious mind becomes dominant during sleep, and is motivated by pleasure (id)
			-	We dream about what we want, especially if it's impossible in real life
		-	Images, thoughts, and emotions that are not acceptable will be repressed into the unconscious while awake
		-	Our control over unconscious thoughts slips when sleeping, and these images result in dreams
		-	Freud believed that dreams had two aspects
			-	Manifest content: What the dream appears to be about, what is remembered
			-	Latent content: What the dream is actually about, what the manifest content symbolises
			-	Understanding a dream involves interpreting the manifest in order to understand the latent
			-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain what is meant by the manifest content and latent content of dreams." (4 marks)`}>
					The manifest content of a dream is what is actually visualised by a person during sleep, and what is remembered after waking up (1). The latent content of a dream is what the dream is believed to actually be about, or what is symbolised by the manifest content. (1)
					
					Latent content is a preview of your unconscious mind, and shows deepest thoughts and desires that cannot be let out in real life. (1)
					
					The true meaning (latent content) of a dream can be found out by interpreting and understanding the manifest content. (1)
				</Question>
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain the psychoanalytical theory of sleep & dreams." (4 marks)`}>
			Wish fulfilment theory: The theory that dreams represent the deep desires from your unconscious mind, especially wishes that cannot happen in real life

			Manifest content of dreams: What your dream appears to be, the visualisations actually experienced and remembered

			Latent content of dreams: What the dream really means, can be interpreted from manifest content

			Example: The Little Hans study, where Sigmund Freud communicated with the father of Little Hans, and asked about the dreams Hans had
		</Question>
	-	<Question client:visible q={`"Explain the scenario using the psychoanalytic (Freudian) theory of dreams." (5 marks) (see note)`}>
			"Rebecca's mum has just given birth to a baby girl and is due home from hospital today. Rebecca puts up a 'Welcome Home' banner in the window. That night, she dreams that the banner says 'Go Away!"

			Wish fulfilment theory states that this means, unconsciously, Rebecca doesn't really want a baby sister. This would be unacceptable to say in real life, so the only time that these thoughts can be released is during dreams, to protect Rebecca from the thoughts while awake. (1)

			The manifest content of the dream is what is actually visualised and remembered (1), and the latent content is what the dream really means, and can be interpreted from the manifest. (1)

			In the conscious mind, the mind that contains current thoughts and is used by the brain while awake, (1) Rebecca wants a little sister and would welcome the baby home. (1)

			In the unconscious mind, the area holding unpleasant or unacceptable thoughts repressed while awake and only released when sleeping, (1) Rebecca secretly does not want a little sister. (1)
